The toxins are synthesized as a single peptide chain which is processed into a mature protein consisting of a heavy chain and light chain joined via a disulfide bond. The botulinum toxin light chain is a zinc-dependent protease which is released from the heavy chain upon ENDOCYTOSIS into PRESYNAPTIC NERVE ENDINGS. Once inside the cell the botulinum toxin light chain cleaves specific SNARE proteins which are essential for secretion of ACETYLCHOLINE by SYNAPTIC VESICLES. This inhibition of acetylcholine release results in muscular PARALYSIS.

The mass effect ofthe abscess can compress and reduce blood flow to the spinal cord, conus medullaris, or cauda equina. Left untreated, the infection can lead to sensory loss,muscle weakness, visceral dysfunction, sepsis, and even death. Early diagnosis is essential to limit mor-bidity and neurologic injury. The classic triad of fever, axial pain, and neurological deficit occurs in as few as 13 percent of patients, highlighting the diagnosticchallenge associated with SEA.
